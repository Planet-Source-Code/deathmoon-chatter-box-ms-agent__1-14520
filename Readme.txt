For this program to work you must download the following from Microsoft:

Text-to-Speech engine
&
Microsoft Agent Character Files
you do not have to download them all but they all have different voices, gestures, etc.

I'm working on a new version currently that allows you to send the "gestures" to the person you are chatting with.  If you have any problems, questions, or enhancements, please let me know!
