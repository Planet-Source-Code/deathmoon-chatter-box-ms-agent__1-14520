### Description

Allows you to chat with another person (you must know each other's IP address). But it doesn't stop there! The text you type goes to the other person's PC and the Agent (rather it be Merlin, Robot, etc.) says what you typed and vs. versa!
 
### More Info
 
You will have to go and download 2 items from Microsoft for this to work (unless you have them already!). The info and links are in a readme file that is included!
